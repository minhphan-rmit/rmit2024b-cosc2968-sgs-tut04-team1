    "The objective of the project is to train a model that will result in a mathematical equation. This equation will use specific input features (such as temperature, water quality, sunlight exposure, etc.) to predict the percentage of coral bleaching. The goal is for this equation to serve as a practical tool, enabling people to pinpoint factors contributing to coral bleaching and to guide them in taking steps to mitigate or prevent it."
