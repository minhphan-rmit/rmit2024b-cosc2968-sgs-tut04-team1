    "- **High Proportion of Missing Data:**\n",
    "  - If a column has 25% or more missing values, it indicates a significant portion of the data is unavailable. This can undermine the reliability of any analysis or modeling performed using that column.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Incomplete Information:**\n",
    "  - With such a high proportion of missing data, the column may not provide a complete or representative view of the feature, potentially leading to biased or incomplete insights.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Bias in Imputation:**\n",
    "  - Imputation methods (mean, median, mode) may not be effective or appropriate for columns with a high percentage of missing values, potentially introducing bias or reducing the validity of the statistical analysis.\n",

    "#### Data Quality\n",

    "\n",
    "Reduced Data Quality: Columns with a lot of missing data can degrade the quality of your dataset, as imputed values might not capture the variability and true relationships within the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simplification of the Model:\n",
    "Avoiding Overfitting: Including columns with many missing values might increase the complexity of the model, leading to overfitting. Removing such columns can simplify the model, making it more generalizable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improving Interpretability: Fewer, more relevant features make it easier to interpret and understand the model. Columns with high missing values often contribute little to the model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Efficient Use of Resources:\n",
    "Reduced Computational Load: By removing columns with a high percentage of missing values, you reduce the dimensionality of your dataset, leading to faster training and testing times. This is particularly important when working with large datasets."

    "#### How Imputation with Mean Works:\n",
