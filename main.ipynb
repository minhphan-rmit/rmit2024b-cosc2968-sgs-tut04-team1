Furthermore, over **500 million people** worldwide **rely on reefs for food, tourism, and employment**, with coral reefs providing protection from extreme weather events and contributing nearly **$30 billion** in estimated value (TIME, 2016).\n","\n","*What is coral bleaching, and why is it a concern?*\n","\n","Despite their importance, coral reefs are increasingly threatened by a phenomenon known as **coral bleaching**. Coral bleaching occurs when corals, stressed by changes in environmental conditions—most notably increased **sea surface temperatures (SSTs)**—expel the symbiotic algae (*zooxanthellae*) that live within their tissues. These algae are crucial to the coral's survival, as they provide energy through **photosynthesis** and contribute to the coral's vibrant colors. The loss of these algae causes the corals to turn white or \"bleach\" and significantly increases their susceptibility to **disease** and **mortality** (Hughes et al., 2017; Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017).\n","\n","*What causes coral bleaching?*\n","\n","The primary driver of coral bleaching is **thermal stress** due to elevated SSTs. Even small increases in SSTs, such as **1°C above the normal maximum temperatures**, can lead to widespread bleaching events, particularly when these elevated temperatures persist for extended periods (Baker, Glynn, & Riegl, 2008). Additional stressors, such as **pollution**, **overfishing**, and **ocean acidification**, can exacerbate the effects of thermal stress, making it more difficult for corals to recover from bleaching events (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2017; Loya et al., 2001).\n","\n","*How has coral bleaching changed over time?*\n","\n","Over the past few decades, the **frequency** and **severity** of coral bleaching events have increased significantly, largely driven by **global climate change** (Hughes et al., 2017). As ocean temperatures continue to rise, the future of coral reefs is increasingly uncertain, with projections suggesting that most coral reefs could experience **annual severe bleaching** by the mid-21st century (Pandolfi et al., 2011). The potential loss of coral reefs would have profound implications not only for **marine ecosystems** but also for human communities that depend on the goods and services provided by healthy coral reefs (Eakin et al., 2016).\n","\n","*What can be done to address coral bleaching?*\n","\n","Understanding the environmental conditions that lead to coral bleaching, such as **sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA)** and **thermal stress anomalies (TSA)**, is crucial for predicting and mitigating the impacts of future bleaching events (Spalding, Ravilious, & Green, 2001). By studying these factors, researchers can develop **early warning systems**, inform **conservation strategies**, and guide efforts to reduce the **anthropogenic stressors** that further endanger coral reefs (Brown, 1997). Addressing coral bleaching is not only a matter of preserving **biodiversity** but is also critical for maintaining the **resilience** and **sustainability** of marine environments and the human economies that depend on them.\n","\n","<figure style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n","    <img src=\"./image/image6.webp\" alt=\"Coral Bleaching\" style=\"width:100%; height:auto; border-radius:15px; object-fit:cover; aspect-ratio: 3/1;\">\n","    <figcaption style=\"font-size: 14px; color: #555; margin-top: 10px;\">\n","        Figure 1: An example of coral bleaching caused by thermal stress.\n","    </figcaption>\n","</figure>\n","\n","### <b><span style='color:#FF6F61'>|</span> Objectives</b> \n","\n","This notebook is designed to systematically analyze the factors contributing to coral bleaching by following a structured approach that includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The primary goals of this notebook are outlined as follows:\n","\n","1. **Data Exploration**:\n","   - **Initial Dataset Inspection**: Load the dataset and conduct an initial exploration to understand its structure, including the types of data, the range of values, and potential anomalies.\n","   - **Descriptive Analysis**: Provide a summary of key variables related to coral bleaching and environmental conditions, such as sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) and thermal stress anomalies (TSA).\n","   - **Visualization**: Utilize various plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, and maps) to visualize distributions, relationships, and geographical patterns in the data.\n","\n","2. **Data Preprocessing**:\n","   - **Data Cleaning**: Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies within the dataset to ensure the quality and reliability of the analysis.\n","   - **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones (e.g., normalizing temperature values, calculating additional stress metrics) to enhance the dataset's utility for modeling.\n","   - **Data Transformation**: Convert categorical data into numeric formats, scale numerical features, and prepare the data for model training.\n","\n","3. **Model Training, Tuning, and Evaluation**:\n","   - **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning models to predict coral bleaching events based on environmental factors, focusing on models that are well-suited to the nature of the data (e.g., regression, classification models).\n","   - **Model Training**: Train the selected models using the processed dataset, applying techniques such as cross-validation to ensure robust performance.\n","   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the models by tuning hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.\n","   - **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using relevant metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, RMSE) and compare the results to select the best-performing model.\n","\n","4. **Conclusion**:\n","   - **Summary of Findings**: Summarize the key insights gained from the data analysis and modeling, particularly in relation to the environmental drivers of coral bleaching.\n","   - **Implications for Conservation**: Discuss the potential applications of the findings for coral reef conservation efforts, including predictive modeling and risk assessment.\n","   - **Future Directions**: Provide suggestions for further research or analysis, particularly in areas that could enhance the understanding of coral reef health and resilience.\n","\n","This structured approach will ensure a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, providing valuable insights into the environmental factors that influence coral bleaching and offering a foundation for predictive modeling in coral reef conservation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## <div style=\"padding:

However, in the context of this study on coral bleaching and building a predictive model, including irrelevant features could lead to unnecessary complexity in the analysis and potentially degrade the model's performance. To enhance the focus and efficiency of the analysis, the dataset was simplified by removing columns that are not directly related to coral bleaching. The following table provides detailed reasons for the removal of each attribute."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["| **Attribute Name**                         | **Reason for Removal**                                                                                                              |\n","|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n","| **Site_ID**                                | This is simply an identifier for the sampling site and does not provide information relevant to environmental conditions or bleaching directly. |\n","| **Sample_ID**                              | Similar to Site_ID, this is an identifier for individual sampling events, not directly relevant to analyzing bleaching causes or effects. |\n","| **Data_Source**                            | This indicates the source of the data collection method but doesn't contribute to understanding the environmental factors affecting coral bleaching. |\n","| **Reef_ID**                                | Although it identifies a specific reef, the specific reef ID itself is not directly relevant to the environmental analysis.
